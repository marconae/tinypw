# tinypw

A tiny, fast CLI tool to generate random passwords.

## What you get
- Sensible defaults: 16 characters, upper+lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and similar-looking characters excluded.
- Simple flags to tweak the character set and length.
- Uses the Rust rand crate for randomness.

## Install
- With Rust installed: clone this repository and run `cargo build --release`.
- Optional: add to PATH: copy `target/release/tinypw` somewhere on your PATH.
- From source without release profile: `cargo run --` followed by options shown below.

## Usage
- Default (no arguments): prints a random password with default settings.
- Set length: `tinypw -l 24`
- Select character set with mode:
  - `-m <mode>` where mode is a combination of letters:
    - u = include uppercase A–Z
    - l = include lowercase a–z
    - n = include digits 0–9
    - s = include symbols !#$&()*+/
    - e = exclude similar-looking characters: i l 1 o 0 O
  - Examples:
    - `tinypw -m ul` only letters (upper+lower)
    - `tinypw -m ulns` letters + numbers + symbols
    - `tinypw -m ulnse` same as above but excluding similar-looking characters

## Current defaults
- Length: 16
- Mode: "ulnse" (upper, lower, numbers, symbols; exclude similar)
- Similar-looking characters excluded set: `il1o0O`
- Symbols used: `!#$&()*+/`

## Planned features
- `-c/--clipboard`: This flag is parsed but copying the password to the clipboard is not implemented yet.
- `-e/--extra <chars>`: This option is parsed but not yet connected in the CLI. The underlying builder supports adding extra characters; wiring this flag is planned.

## Exit codes
- 0 on success.
- Non-zero on invalid arguments (clap prints a helpful error message).

How it works (brief)
- The CLI parses flags using the `clap` crate.
- It builds a base character set from your chosen mode, optionally excluding similar characters.
- A password is generated by sampling uniformly at random from that base set for the chosen length using `rand` 0.9.
